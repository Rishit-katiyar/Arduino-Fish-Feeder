# Arduino Fish Feeder üêü

Welcome to the Arduino Fish Feeder project! This project allows you to automate the feeding of your aquatic pets using an Arduino board, a DS1302 real-time clock module, and a servo motor. With precise scheduling and portion control, you can ensure that your fish are fed regularly and maintain their health and well-being.

## Features

- **Automation**: Set specific feeding times to ensure your fish are fed at regular intervals, even when you're not around.
- **Precision**: Utilizes a DS1302 real-time clock module for accurate timekeeping, ensuring your fish are fed at the exact times you specify.
- **Customization**: Easily adjust feeding schedules and portion sizes to meet the dietary needs of different fish species.
- **Reliability**: Built with reliable Arduino hardware and components, providing consistent and dependable operation.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following components:

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- DS1302 real-time clock module
- Servo motor
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional)

### Step-by-Step Installation Guide

1. **Install Arduino IDE**: Download and install the latest version of the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) on your computer.

2. **Install Required Libraries**:

   - **DS1302 Library**: This library provides functions to interact with the DS1302 real-time clock module.

     ```bash
     arduino-cli lib install DS1302RTC
     ```

   - **Servo Library**: This library provides functions to control servo motors.

     ```bash
     arduino-cli lib install Servo
     ```

3. **Download Fish Feeder Code**: Clone or download the Arduino Fish Feeder repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Rishit-katiyar/Arduino-Fish-Feeder.git
    ```

4. **Open Arduino Sketch**: Open the Arduino sketch file (`fish_feeder.ino`) in the Arduino IDE.

5. **Connect Hardware**: Connect your Arduino board, DS1302 real-time clock module, and servo motor according to the provided schematics.

6. **Upload Code**: Upload the fish feeder sketch to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.

7. **Set Feeding Schedule**: Adjust the feeding schedule in the code to specify the times at which you want your fish to be fed.

    ```cpp
    // Set initial time
    rtc.setTime(9, 55, 0); // Set initial feeding time to 9:55:00
    ```

8. **Monitor Operation**: Monitor the operation of your fish feeder to ensure it is functioning correctly and adjust settings as needed.

## Usage

- **Monitor Operation**: Use the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE to view the current time and debug any issues with your fish feeder.

- **Customize Feeding Schedule**: Modify the feeding schedule in the code to match the feeding requirements of your fish.

- **Adjust Servo Position**: Fine-tune the servo motor position to dispense the desired amount of food for your fish.
